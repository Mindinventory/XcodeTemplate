# Project Template

Project template is nothing but the group of resuable files which will be created automatically when you select and configure your template as a project.

# Set Up to Install the Project Template

Go to the path ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/ where you can create you own project template folder with the extension **.xctemplate**
Add require Image files which will be useful while showing project template in Xcode pannel and modifiled Info.plist file. You will find more on this over [MEDIUM](https://medium.com/mindful-engineering/notification-customization-446a7ffde8c2)
Once you add the folder with images and info.plist file it will look like
