# Xcode Template
Xcode Template can be two types either file template or Project Templates. Let's see how the Project Template will be configured and work. Find and read more in detail on [MEDIUM](https://medium.com/mindful-engineering/create-custom-xcode-templates-908fdd14fbd8)

# Project Template
A project template is nothing but a group of reusable files which will be created automatically when you select and configure your template as a project.

# Set Up to Install the Project Template
Go to the path ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/ where you can create your own project template folder with the extension **.xctemplate**
Add require Image files which will be useful while showing project template in Xcode panel and modified Info.plist file. You will find more on this over [MEDIUM](https://medium.com/mindful-engineering/create-custom-xcode-templates-908fdd14fbd8)

Once you add the folder with images and info.plist file it will look like

Now add the required folder and files to add to the project template and your folder for the Project template will be structured like below

Once you add this template in your Xcode from the pannel the final project will be created with the following files and folder
